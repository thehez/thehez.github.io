# Hez's HackHarbor Discoveries

Hello and welcome to my page! 

My name is Christian - Aka theHez - a seasoned security engineer and penetration tester deeply committed to the domains of security and cloud technology. My extensive cyber security journey has taken me through several environments including sensitive projects witin the public and private sectors. From military ops to fintech fun, where security is not a dirty word even if 'crevice' is. (points for references!)

This website is not just a blog; it's a personal project aimed at sharing interesting information, showcasing my skills, and giving back to the infosec community. While I do not claim to boast "l33t" status, I've worked on multiple intriguing projects and learned a lot of lessons along the way. My goal is to attempt to share some of this useful information, offering practical tips and advice that will hopefully benefit and inspire others in the field.

## Why all the Nautical Themes?

Before we 'Dive' in ðŸ˜‰... You might be wondering about all the nautical references. Well, it wasn't just a random choice â€” it's a reflection of my personal experience in cloud security, particularly with containers.

In the expansive world of containerization and orchestration, tools such as Docker and Kubernetes are rife with maritime metaphors. The choice of nautical themes not only adds a creative and memorable touch to these technologies but also aligns with the concepts of containerized shipping, smooth navigation, and orchestrating a fleet of containers or ships in the vast digital ocean. 

Unfortunately, I'm not sharp enough to come up with own themes or go against the current, so consider these nautical nods my way of attempting to play on that idea and add a touch of humor. I promise to try and keep them to a minimum!

## Setting Sail into Security

This blog is your compass to the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity. Here's a glimpse of what awaits you:

- **Penetration Testing:** - with insights into the latest tools and techniques.

- **Security Engineering:** ideas and lessons learned as I share experience for secure system design.

- **General Security Topics:** that matter in today's digital landscape.

- **Demos and Lessons:** practical demonstrations and lessons to deepen your cybersecurity expertise.

## Beyond the Keyboard

In my off-hours, I juggle roles as a partner and a proud father to two wonderful children. When I'm not decoding cybersecurity challenges, you'll find me outdoors - running, hiking, camping and 'attemping' to compete in triathlons - otherwise absorbed in a good book, or strumming chords on my guitar.
